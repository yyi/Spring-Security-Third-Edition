## About the Book
Knowing that experienced hackers are itching to test your skills makes security one of the most difficult and high-pressured concerns of creating an application. The complexity of properly securing an application is compounded when you must also integrate this factor with existing code, new technologies, and other frameworks. Use this book to easily secure your Java application with the tried and trusted Spring Security framework, a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The technical requirement is mentioned in the Appendix.

The code will look like the following:
```
//build.gradle:
    dependencies {
        compile "org.springframework.security:spring-security-  
        config:${springSecurityVersion}"
        compile "org.springframework.security:spring-security- 
        core:${springSecurityVersion}"
        compile "org.springframework.security:spring-security- 
        web:${springSecurityVersion}"
        ...
